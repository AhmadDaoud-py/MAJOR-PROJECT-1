# MAJOR-PROJECT-1
# Food Waste Control
We have seen in our Canteen at Marwadi University food is wasted too much. we have observed some 
student took food from menu and they brought it back without eating it. People outside are starving and a lot 
of food is wasting in here. 
In the other side, when a lot of food is wasted and stored outside of canteen. This brings bad smelling. As we 
go to canteen and come out from canteen we are always suffering with bad smelling.
So, this has to get solution by controlling student using some technologies. we want to train a machine to 
detect amount of food left on plate and if the left over is much, it detects who is he/she using face detection.
And after detecting the individuals we are going to process the data and many Parameters is going to be 
there based on the rules which we want to apply, for example “if the plate contain more than 20% food 
waste warning will be there and after few warnings a punishment will take place, and less than 5% a reward 
points is going to be counted.”
This system can work in another dining places in different occasions such as weddings, parties…etc
